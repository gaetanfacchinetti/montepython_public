# Lyman-alpha likelihood based on the alpha-beta-gamma
# approach described in 1704.07838 and 1806.08371.
# Full likelihood described in detail in 1907.01496.
# Likelihood written by M. Archidiacono, R. Murgia,
# D.C. Hooper, J. Lesgourgues, and M. Viel.

# This likelihood should always be used together with
# a CMB likelihood (e.g. Planck).

# Important! This likelihood requires CLASS version 2.9 or higher.


# Data directory and bin file (for models that fail the checks)
